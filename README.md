# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
A repository dedicated to analysis, investigation and summarization of the main characteristics of certain datasets.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) comprises analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. 
It helps specify how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers one needs, making it easier for data scientists to uncover patterns, spot irregularities, test a hypothesis, or inspect assumptions.
EDA is predominantly used to see what data can display beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and delivers a better insight into data set variables and their relationships. 
It can also help decide if the statistical approaches one is considering for data analysis are suitable. The primary purpose of EDA is to assist in looking at data before making any assumptions.
It can help identify apparent errors, better comprehend patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, and find intriguing relations among the variables. 
Exploratory analysis can be used to ensure that the results are valid and appropriate to any preferred business outcomes and goals. EDA also helps stakeholders by ensuring they are asking the right questions. 
It answers questions about standard deviations, categorical variables, and confidence intervals. Once EDA is complete, its features can then be used for more refined data analysis or modeling.
