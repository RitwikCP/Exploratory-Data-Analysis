## OBJECTIVE
This work aims to do a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the [gun violence dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jameslko/gun-violence-data) obtained from the kaggle website. Visualizing different aspects of the data and drawing logical inferences from it to reason the characteristic features of the dataset are the defining attributes of this work.

## MOTIVATION
To get a hands-on experience of Data analysis and understand different data visualisation techniques, their appropriate usage, the art of inference making, reasoning and giving explanations for anomalies. Moreover, to gain experience in using python libraries made for data analysis, and to create a project that showcases both programming and analysis skills.

## DATASET
The dataset was downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jameslko/gun-violence-data). The source of the data is [gunviolencearchive.org](http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/),  a not for profit corporation formed in 2013 to provide free online public access to accurate information about gun-related violence in the United States. GVA collects and checks for accuracy, comprehensive information about gun-related violence in the U.S. and then posts and disseminates it online. The dataset is a record of more than 260k gun violence incidents, with detailed information about each incident, available in CSV format. It contains data for all recorded gun violence incidents in the US between January 2013 and March 2018, inclusive.

## WORK DESCRIPTION
The work has been carried out using jupyter notebook with proper explanations, giving description of each technique/function used as well as the inferences drawn from the results obtained after carrying out each of these techniques. The jupyter notebook, in itself, is self explanatory. Do check it for precise explanation of the code and inferences drawn.

## CONCLUSION
With the analysis of the gun violence dataset, it can be concluded that gun violence is progressively increasing yearly and will continue to do so unless strict laws in the US prevent these incidents from occurring. It turns out that no. of people involved in incidents is more or less increasing every year as well. July and August seem to be the months with the most incidents every year, with July 4th and 5th specifically being days with alarming no. of incidents. Furthermore, The weekends happen to be the unsafest days of the week. Coming to individual states, Illinois and California top the chart for most incidents. However, the moment population-adjusted analysis is carried out, one cannot fail to notice that Alaska (for most incidents per 100,000 people) and Louisiana (for the most killings and injuries per 100,000 people) stand at the top. For cities, Chicago has the maximum incidents, but New Orleans, Louisiana tops in population-adjusted analysis. According to the analysis, Walmart and McDonald's have proven to be quite vicious because the number of incidents is very high in these public spaces. Gender-wise, males have more involvement in these, but females are more likely to be killed or injured in gun violence, as evidenced by the dataset. 20-30 year age group people are the most involved in shooting incidents. Analyzing each age individually, it can be said that 18 and 19-year-olds have the most extensive involvement. Coming to guns, Handguns, 9mm ones, and Rifles are the most popular choices for the subjects, and most of the incidents have been witnessed with only one gun. Overall, these are the most important facts from this exploratory data analysis.
